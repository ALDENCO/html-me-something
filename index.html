        <div = class="Top"><ul><p><li> As a coder I'd mostly like to get to the point where I had the flexiblity to work remotely.  
        I'm interested in continuing my coding education by learning Javascript and the like, whatever I need to learn
        to stay relevant and employable.</li></p>

        <p><li> My biggest concern is finding enjoyable employers whom I can set reasonable expectations with so that I'm not
        overwhelmed with unrealistic requests that I'm unable to deliver on or that leads to damaging my reputation as a coder, i.e. in any way infringes upon my ability to continue working remotely.</li></p>

        <p><li> I am most apprehensive about the interview stage of proving that I can reliably solve problems and create desirable solutions
        that strengthen my reputation to ensure quality delivery of coding projects and continue to gain employment </li></p></ul>

<head> <h1> My Project Ideas for the end of Coding 103 </h1> </head>
    <section>
        <ul>
        <p><li> <div class ="MySecond">I want to utilize my inside knowledge working at the BBB to provide desirable, economical solutions to the Denver metro business market (I think the US needs a quality job search database. I want to connect employers and job seekers with a credible meeting place
        in which actual, available jobs are listed and kept current.)</div></li></p> 
        </ul> 

            <ol>
            <li>My plan is to start by creating a reputable job search site for the state of Colorado.</li> 
            <li>I want to create a site that pulls from various job websites, consolidates repeat entries and essentially scores or rates 
            the job listing based on it's popularity or ubiquity across multiple job sites.</li>
            <li> I then plan to use a deep web research tool that I discovered and utlitized while working with the BBB that provides active email addresses associated with a website.</li>
            <li> Finally, I aim to work with local chamber members and/or the BBB to connect their BBB rating and information to the company's job listing, so that objective information can
            be provided for job seekers and quality employers.</li>
            </ol>

<p><ul><li> <div class = "MySecond">My second idea is to create a cheaper sales lead offering that pulls from the SOS API, and other open, free databases like Google Maps and FourSquare to ensure quality database information.</div></li></ul>
    <ol>
    <li> I know for a fact that small businesses are hard up for quality sales leads and I was a lead researcher in the effort to raise the quality of the BBB's database locally.</li>
    </ol>
